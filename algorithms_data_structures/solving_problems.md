# Problem Solving

## Approaches

### Examplify

Write out a simple example of the problem

### Pattern Matching

Is the problem similar to something else? 
Modify the related solution to suit this one

### Simplify and Generalize

- change the problem so it's simpler
- solve this simpler version
- generalize

### Base Case and Build

- solve for the base case
- try to solve for the next case
- find way to always compute for n given n-1

### Data Structure Brainstorm

- just go through the data structures and see what works

### Choosing the right Alg

`straight coding`: step by step instructions given
`BFS`: number of step or shortest path with certain constraints
`flood fill`: like BFS but no path asked for (find all reachable areas)
`brute-force/backtracking`: find every possible config/subset of items
