# Object Oriented Concepts

## Encapsulation

- grouping data and behaviour into one entity (class)
- hide implementation, only give interface

## Composition

- one object type contains another, without knowing workings of other, just interface

## Inheritance

- cat extends mammal
- attributes can be overrided, attributes can be added

## Abstraction

- model classes as they are used, hide unnecessary details
- work at appropriate Inheritance level (vehicle vs car)

## Polymorphism

- methods or operators performing differently based on object type
- use same underlying Inheritance, but adapt to fit your context
