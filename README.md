Notes on algorithms, data structures, etc.

- python tools like itertools

~~~ ADTs
-Set (Unordered collection, no duplicates)
-Multiset/bag (Unordered collection, duplicates allowed)
-List (Ordered sequence, duplicates allowed (finite seq))
-Container/class (Collection of objects)

~~~ Math stuff
-log rules, power stuff
-Math 122 stuff.
-pascalâ€™s triangle?
-random walk?
-normal dist

~~~ Common Algs:
-In place merge sort & heap sort with linear time heap building.
-tree insert/find
-Dijkstra's algorithm w/ fibonacci heap
-Kruskal's algorithm w/ union find by rank
-deterministic quick select
-polymorphic type inference
-2D voronoi diagram generation
-2D convex hull generation
-Knapsack & related DP problems
-plane sweep

~~~ Concepts
memory (stack vs heap)
recursion
double sided search

~~~ Etc:
-minmax, markov chains?

~~~ common problems
Compute all Permutations of String
Compute all Combinations of Set
N Queens
8-puzzle
