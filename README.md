## To do

### Math stuff

- Log rules, power stuff
- Counting, combinatorics
- Pascalâ€™s triangle?
- Random walk?
- Normal dist
- Markov chains

### Algs

- Dynamic programming
- In-place merge sort & heap sort with linear time heap building
- tree insert/find
- Dijkstra's algorithm w/ fibonacci heap
- Kruskal's algorithm w/ union find by rank
- Deterministic quick select
- 2D voronoi diagram generation
- 2D convex hull generation
- Knapsack & related DP problems
- Plane sweep
- Double sided search
- Minimax

### Languages

- functional / oo

### Problems

- Compute all Permutations of String
- Compute all Combinations of Set
- N Queens
- 8-puzzle

### Concepts

- Memory (stack vs heap)
- Polymorphic type-inference

### Web

- Photoshop XD / Sketch
- CSS (box model, flexbox, css grid, custom properties)
- SASS (structured CSS, variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance)
- Responsive (set viewport, fluid widths, media queries, rem over px, mobile first, stacked columns)
- Hosting/Deployment (SSL, HTTPS, CI/CD, nginx, docker)
- HTML/CSS framework (Bootstrap, Materialize)
- Package managers (npm, yarn)
- Module bundling (webpack)
- Task runners (gulp, grunt. maybe not needed)

- Front-end frameworks (React)
- State manager (Redux)
- Testing
- Fancy stuff (GraphQL, Apollo, Typescript)
