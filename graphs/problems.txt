### Common Problems

~~~ Clique Problem (find largest complete subgraph)
`Clique`: subset of vertices all adjacent to each other (complete subgraphs, ie maximally connected). If the graph is a social network then the clique can be viewed as people who all know each other. NP-Complete

~~~ Independent Set
`Independent Set`: is a set of vertices, no two of which are Adjacent. For any two vertices, there is no edge between them. 
`Maximally Independent`: Independent set of largest size. NP-hard optimization problem. 

~~~ Travelling Salesman
-given a list of cities, visit each once and return to start (taking shortest path) NP-hard

~~~ Four color Theorem

~~~ Hamiltonian Path
