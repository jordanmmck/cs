# Graphs

## Concept

A graph is a collection of nodes and edges which connect nodes to each other. 
A graph can be described by 2 sets, G = (V,E). 
A connected graph must have at least v-1 edges. 
The maximum edges is v(v-1)/2.

## Representations

### Adjacency List

-better for sparse graph

### Adjacency Matrix

-Make n by n matrix of 0/1s indicating presence of edges
-`Laplacian Matrix` has info about the degrees of vertices
-`Distance Matrix` has length value of shortest path between the given vertices
