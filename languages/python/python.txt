### Hitchhiker's Guide to Python

-a `module` is a single python file or files imported as one thing
-a `package` is a directory of python modules creating some hierarchy containing a __init__.py (to indicate that it is not just a bunch of py files)
-`site-packages` is where 3rd party packages go (/usr/local/lib/python3)

~~~ CPython (reference implementation of py)
-written in C, compiles to bytecode which is interpreted by a vm

~~~ Files
.py source code, .pyc compiled bytecode

~~~ Strings
`raw string (so we don't have to escape stuff)`: r'^$'

~~~ Modules
Pretty print, json 

~~~ Objects
-variable names are just pointers to objects, the type lives with object
-objects have reference counter and type designation 
-variable assigned to another var will point to the object
L=[1, 2,3]
M=L
L==M true same values
L is M true same object 
-but py caches small commonly used objects. So 
a=1
b=1
a is b true
