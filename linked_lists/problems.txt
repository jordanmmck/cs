### Common Problems

~~~ Cycle Detection
Q: Detect whether a cycle exists in a linked list.
A: Create two pointers. One fast, one slow. Start them at the start. Slow runner moves along one node at a time. Fast runner moves 2 nodes at time. If they ever point to the same node then there is a cycle. If either hits the end then no cycle.
