# e (2.71828)

$1 in bank:
100% interest per year
50% interest per 6 months

1/12% interest per month...
$1*(1 + 1/12)^12 = $2.61

1/52% interest per week...
$1*(1 + 1/52)^52 = $2.69

1/365% interest per week...
$1*(1 + 1/365)^365 = $2.71

//we get more money the smaller the interval.
//what if we did continuously?

1 + (1/n)^n = 2.71828...
n->inf

e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...

value = gradient = area under curve (from point to -inf)
for any point!

//therefore e is a natural fit for calculus.
//...And of course e^ipi+1=0
