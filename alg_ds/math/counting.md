There's `2^n` ways to write a binary string.
First spot can be 1 or 0, next one can be 1 or 0, ...


## Combinations

`nCk = n!/k!(n-k)!` ways to choose items from set

## Max Connected Graph

`n(n-1)/2` n-1 edges per node, but don't count them twice

## Powerset

`2^N` size of powerset where N is size of set
