# Graphs

## Concept

- collection of nodes and edges
- can be described by 2 sets, G = (V,E)
- connected graph must have at least v-1 edges
- maximum edges is v(v-1)/2

## Representations

### Adjacency List

- better for sparse graph

### Adjacency Matrix

- Make n by n matrix of 0/1s indicating presence of edges
- `Laplacian Matrix` has info about the degrees of vertices
- `Distance Matrix` has length value of shortest path between the given vertices
